			Microprocessor technology
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;">
				microprocessor, any of a type of miniature electronic device that contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry necessary to perform the functions of a digital computer’s central processing unit. In effect, this kind of integrated circuit can interpret and execute program instructions as well as handle arithmetic operations.<br>

				In the early 1970s the introduction of large-scale integration (LSI)—which made it possible to pack thousands of transistors, diodes, and resistors onto a silicon chip less than 0.2 inch (5 mm) square—led to the development of the microprocessor. The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004, which was introduced in 1971. During the early 1980s very large-scale integration (VLSI) vastly increased the circuit density of microprocessors. In the 2010s a single VLSI circuit holds billions of electronic components on a chip identical in size to the LSI circuit.

		 Vaccum Tube
		 </h2>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		    A vacuum tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating.<br>

		Evolution of Sensors
</h2>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		    Sensor technology is the measurement of various information by sensors. Sensor technology is a general term for technologies that quantify and utilize information obtained by sensing in this way. Sensor technology includes measurement, quantification, and transmission.
			In sensor technology, various possibilities are created by applying quantitative data obtained by sensors. The spread of IoT has further increased its potential and importance. In the IoT where things and the Internet are connected, what is actually handled is information that represents the state of things. Sensor technology plays a role in acquiring this information, and it is expected to be applied to all industries as an indispensable technology for IoT.<br>

ARM
</h2>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		    Arm is a British semiconductor and software design company based in Cambridge, England.[7] Its primary business is in the design of ARM processors (CPUs). It also designs other chips, provides software development tools under the DS-5, RealView and Keil brands, and provides systems and platforms, system-on-a-chip (SoC) infrastructure and software. As a "holding" company, it also holds shares of other companies. Since 2016, it has been owned by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.<br>
