	 My name is <b>Kinetebeb Tesfaye</b> ID:<b>UGE/18715/12</b>. I am a 3rd year computer science student at Maddawalabu University and I love computer science.<br><br>

	I chose computer science because I had a strong interest in technology and technological issues from an early age. My dad saw my love for technology and bought me a computer when I was in 6th grade.

	Gradually, my love for computers grew. As a result, I began to study this subject to further my interest in science.

	Now that I am well on my way to school, I plan to develop my own software that will benefit the community and Ethiopia as soon as I graduate.
	I also plan to pursue a master's degree in software engineering.<br><br>

	Readers! That should be sufficient enough for me to say so myself today. Thank you for taking the time to read my article.
